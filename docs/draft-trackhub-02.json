The exact configuration of the display for each mode depends upon the track's type, and some modes may not be supported for certain track types. Valid settigs: 1. hide: DEFAULT. The track is not displayed in the Browser image unless the user changes the display setting; 2. dense: The track is displayed as a single line or ribbon. In many cases multiple items are summarized or drawn on top of one another, and the long labels are not displayed; 3. squish: Each item is drawn individually, but at half height and without a label. (Not supported for all types.); 4. pack: Items are displayed individually at full height, but in a much more compact vertical space than in full mode. (Not supported for all types.); 5. full: Each item is displayed as a separate line in the Browser image. Graphed signals may be displayed in varying heights."
